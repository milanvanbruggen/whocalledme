# Scope: Voice Workflow & Integrations

Focus on n8n flows, ElevenLabs agent configuration, and integration scripts connecting the voice call pipeline to Supabase.

## Key Objectives
- Standardize consent script and fallback messaging for all outbound calls.
- Handle retries, voicemail detection, and unreachable states gracefully.
- Return normalized payloads that UI and analytics expect.

## Guardrails
- Keep integration credentials in secure stores; test with sandbox numbers first.
- Respect region restrictions (EU-only) and schedule windows to avoid off-hours disturbances.
- Document each workflow step for auditing and hand-off.
