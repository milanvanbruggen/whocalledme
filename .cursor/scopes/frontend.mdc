# Scope: Frontend Experience

Focus on building user-facing flows including homepage hero, number result pages, and supporting UI components.

## Key Objectives
- Maintain ShadCN UI styling, accessibility, and responsive layout.
- Keep copy aligned with product tone (“smart detective”).
- Ensure state flows reflect call lifecycle states (`idle`, `calling`, `identified`, `failed`).

## Guardrails
- Do not embed API secrets or call ElevenLabs directly from the client.
- Always provide compliance links and privacy notice in the footer.
- Validate phone numbers before dispatching server actions.
