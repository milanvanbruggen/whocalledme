# Frontend Implementation Guidelines

## Stack
- Next.js App Router (TypeScript) with Tailwind + ShadCN UI primitives.
- Use server components by default; isolate client components when stateful UI or effects are needed.
- Centralize shared utilities in `lib/` and UI primitives in `components/ui/`.

## UX Principles
- Primary entry is a single search field for phone lookup.
- Provide immediate feedback: loading state, success result summary, and fallback when no data yet.
- Keep copy concise and reassuring; avoid fear-based wording.
- Use pastel accent palette defined in `app/globals.css`.

## Component Practices
- Create composable sections (hero, how-it-works, compliance notice) instead of monolithic pages.
- Prefer accessible components (labels, aria attributes, keyboard focus states).
- Wrap long-form copy in layout containers limited to 2xl width for readability.

## SEO & Metadata
- Generate metadata per number page (`/nummer/[digits]`) including title, description, open graph tags.
- Include structured data (JSON-LD) for organization/person when identification is confident.

## Testing & QA
- Snapshot-check key pages once UI stabilizes.
- Validate that dynamic routing handles both `+31` and `0031` formats.
- Ensure layout remains responsive from 320px up to desktop widths.
