# Feature: AI Call Orchestration & Transcript Capture

## User Story
As a user, when I request identification the system should place an AI-powered call, capture who answers, and store a short transcript so I can review what was said.

## Outcome
- n8n workflow triggers ElevenLabs call with standardized opening consent script.
- Call responses mapped to structured payload (`type`, `name`, `company`, `notes`, `confidence`).
- Transcript summarized to <= 180 characters for SEO snippet.
- Workflow posts results and call metrics back to Supabase via REST service role key.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Consent message plays before collecting any information.
- If voicemail detected, mark status `voicemail` and store transcript preview.
- Errors (busy, unreachable) logged with retry metadata and surfaced to UI.
- Audio stored in secure bucket with retention policy ≤30 days.

## Technical Notes
- Represent workflow states using Supabase `call_attempts` table with triggers for analytics.
- Use N8N credential vault; never store ElevenLabs secrets client-side.
- Provide test harness numbers (mock provider) to validate flows without real calls.
