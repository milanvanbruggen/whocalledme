# Feature: Analytics Dashboard Starter

## User Story
As the founder, I want to monitor call throughput and identification accuracy so I can gauge traction and cost efficiency.

## Outcome
- Admin-only route showing daily lookups, successful identifications, retries, and spend estimates.
- Highlight conversion funnel: searches → calls placed → identifications → verified.
- Include filters by country code and call outcome.
- Export basic CSV for deeper analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Metrics sourced from Supabase SQL or materialized views updated hourly.
- Accuracy rate and average call duration displayed with deltas.
- Dashboard gated with simple password or Vercel protect (until auth added).
- Error budget indicator warns if failures exceed 20% on any given day.

## Technical Notes
- Use Supabase Row Level Security to lock down analytics tables.
- Consider collecting events via Supabase Edge Functions to avoid client writes.
- Lay groundwork for future Chart.js or Tremor components but keep MVP simple (cards + sparklines).
