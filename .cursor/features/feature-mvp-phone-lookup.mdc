# Feature: MVP Phone Lookup Flow

## User Story
As a visitor who received a missed call, I want to enter a phone number and immediately see whether AI Caller ID can identify the caller so I can decide if I should return the call.

## Outcome
- Desktop and mobile visitors land on a hero section with single prominent input.
- Submitting validates number format, shows loading state, and hands off to the AI call workflow.
- If recent data exists, show cached identification instantly with timestamp.
- When no data exists yet, communicate that the AI agent is calling and invite user to check back or subscribe.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Input accepts international formats (`+31612345678`, `0031612345678`, `0612345678`).
- While call in progress, UI shows live status updates via Supabase realtime or polling.
- Results include identification summary, call outcome badge, and compliance notice.
- Errors (invalid number, agent quota exceeded) surface clear recovery actions.

## Technical Notes
- Use zod schema for validation shared between client and server actions.
- Persist searches for analytics including source (direct/SEO) and call status.
- Expose React Query or equivalent SWR hook for polling call status updates.
