# Feature: Number Profile & SEO Landing Page

## User Story
As a visitor arriving from search, I want a fast, mobile-friendly page summarizing who owns the number plus transcript context so I can trust the information.

## Outcome
- Dynamic route `/nummer/[digits]` renders identifier hero, trust indicators, and transcript snippet.
- Includes consent timestamp, call type, and crowd validation (“X people confirmed this”).
- Secondary modules: “What to do next”, “Report incorrect info”, and call-to-action for businesses to claim profile (placeholder for future).
- Generate static metadata for social sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders within <200ms on cached hit and <1s when fallback generating.
- Structured data JSON-LD provided when name/company is known.
- Contains canonical link, meta description and open graph tags.
- Displays legal disclaimer and link to removal request.

## Technical Notes
- Prefer incremental static regeneration with fallback `blocking`.
- Use Supabase edge function/webhook to revalidate path after new transcript arrives.
- Consider storing sanitized transcript summary in `phone_profiles` table to avoid running summarization on every request.
